### This guide explains how to use Python to send database query results directly from the server to the client without loading the entire result set into memory first. You'll learn how to optimize memory usage and improve performance by streaming results one row at a time, using the Python libraries and techniques outlined in this guide. Whether you're working with small or large datasets, this approach can help you minimize memory usage and speed up query execution times.
